I am a third-year graduate student in the Department of Mathematics at The University of Texas at Austin. I work in applied mathematics under the advisory of Professor Joe Kileel. My current research interests are in geometric methods in data science and randomized algorithms in multilinear algebra. Here is my CV.

During the 2023-2024 academic year, I am a member of the Graduate Representative Committee of the Department of Mathematics.
